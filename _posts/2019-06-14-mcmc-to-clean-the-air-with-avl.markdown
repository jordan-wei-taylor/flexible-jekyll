[//]: # (AVL is a consulting firm that conducts research within the automotive industry. One of the challenges they faced was to have a data-driven model to replace their complicated physical modelling of the interactions between various chemicals within a car engine. Specifically, they are interested in reducing emissions by injecting the correct amount of ad-blue into an engine. Too little and the car still produces emissions but too much means producing ammonia in place of the usual emissions!)
